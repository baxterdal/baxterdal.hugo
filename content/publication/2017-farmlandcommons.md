abstract = "Farmland tenure – the set of property rights available to farmers in relation to the land they use to produce food – is insecure when those rights are undefined or unclear; when they are clearly defined but inconsistently enforced by the state or through social norms; and/or when they are impermanent, persisting only for a lim- ited and perhaps indeterminate period of time. Separately or together, each of these aspects of farmland tenure insecurity introduces an element of uncertainty into decisions about land use and food production, thereby reducing farmers’ incentives and capacities to invest in practices and material improvements that would achieve better ecological, economic and social outcomes. The conventional suite of legal and policy responses to farmland tenure insecurity as a cause of food insecurity have, unfortunately, tended mainly to reproduce farmers’ precarity rather than offer lasting solutions. Fortunately, recent thinking and practice has started to clear the way for us to envision the \"farmland commons\" as a serious alternative to addressing both dimensions of this problem."
